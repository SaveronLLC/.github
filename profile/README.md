## Ayo, welcome to Saveron Industries :wave:

While we develop some open source projects, you can sit back and enjoy the simple codelines for free*, who doesn't want to feel comfortable and make changes to some ready-made ones? Yeah! That's exactly how we thought and founded Saveron Industries. Thanks to some of the features we have experienced in the past[*](https://github.com/AestasFlores), we have some project ideas that can be more stable and easier to use for everyone, we will work on these ideas!

## Projects

Are you developing a website? Are you lost among style codes in a project? Code lines giving you headache? Want more stable plugins? Want customizable codes, pages, alerts, entries? Alright, deal! You'll find each of these things we've listed here. We will try to prepare them for you.

## Gotta mess with something!

Since we are proficient in writing some pure code for frontend, we are excited to prepare more stable, more convenient, faster projects for you. We are open to work. We believe this. We hope that all the projects we have listed here can help you at least a little bit and make your work or works easier. :shipit:
